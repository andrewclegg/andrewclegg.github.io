    <h3><a href="../culture/YouSureDontLookLikeAScientist.html">You sure don&#8217;t look like a&nbsp;scientist</a></h3>
  </div>
  <div id="article_text">
    <p>You get a little tired of people asking what you do, when the answer&#8217;s &#8220;computational linguistics research in a bioinformatics group at the Institute for Structural Molecular Biology.&#8221; There are enough unfamiliar terms in there to derail a light social conversation several times over, especially when you don&#8217;t usually enjoy talking about work at parties. So I got into the habit of saying &#8220;I&#8217;m a scientist&#8221; and glossing over the details unless people were&nbsp;interested.</p>
<p>The reactions from laypeople tend to run the whole gamut from intrigue to wariness and even, back in the days, occasionally outright hostility. Ten years ago, the 90s &#8220;Frankenscience&#8221; narrative was still lingering around, and the popular images associated with bioscience included <span class="caps">GM</span> crop protests, ears grown on mice, Dolly the sheep, and the horrific undercover pics from Huntingdon Life Sciences that the <span class="caps">ALF</span> put on every high street. Sometimes even fellow academics I met from arts and humanities departments would totally change their demeanour when they heard a trigger word like &#8220;lab.&#8221; I always felt particularly disappointed when that&nbsp;happened.</p>
<p>Another pretty common response was &#8220;Really? You don&#8217;t look like a scientist.&#8221; Now this usually just amused and exasperated me in roughly equal measures &#8212; and still does occasionally. But one time it nearly got me&nbsp;deported.</p>
<h4>Boston&nbsp;manners</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s 2004, and I&#8217;m arriving in Boston for <a href="http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~pablo/hlt-naacl04/"><span class="caps">HLT</span>-<span class="caps">NAACL</span>&#8216;04</a>. I&#8217;m in the first year of my PhD, going to my first international conference &#8212; and my first trip outside Europe for any reason. It&#8217;s the height of summer, and I&#8217;m in combat shorts and a sleeveless t-shirt as usual. I get to the front of the immigration queue and hand over my documents. &#8220;Business or vacation?&#8221; asks the border&nbsp;guard.</p>
<p>Neither really, I think to myself. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to an academic conference,&#8221; I say instead, and give its full name. &#8220;I&#8217;m a PhD&nbsp;student.&#8221;</p>
<p>This wasn&#8217;t in the script. She stops pecking at her keyboard, squints at me over her glasses and chews this over for a moment. &#8220;You&#8217;re a <em>scientist</em>?&#8221; Nod. &#8220;You coulda fooled me. You sure don&#8217;t look like a&nbsp;scientist.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a bit floored by this &#8212; particularly as there&#8217;s an unsettling mix of contempt and distrust creeping into her voice. I can&#8217;t think of anything to say that isn&#8217;t hazardously sarcastic, so I wave the conference details printout at her. She glances at it, not really interested, and calls over a colleague. &#8220;This guy says he&#8217;s a scientist, huh. Going to a&nbsp;conference.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Oh really?&#8221; chuckles the guy. &#8220;Whereabouts?&#8221; The Park Plaza. He laughs a bit more. &#8220;They won&#8217;t even let you <em>in</em> the Park Plaza looking like that! Now please come with&nbsp;me.&#8221;</p>
<p>So he leads me to an inspection booth, and somewhere along the way, acquires another goon with a very large sniffer&nbsp;dog.</p>
<h4>Waive goodbye to your&nbsp;rights</h4>
<p>By now I&#8217;m starting to get seriously worried. Why the disbelief? I&#8217;m in my work clothes. I&#8217;ve got a slightly punky haircut and a couple of tattoos visible, but nothing you wouldn&#8217;t see in London every day. And this is Massachusetts, not Arkansas,&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>But more importantly &#8212; I&#8217;m travelling on a visa waiver form. This gives you exactly <strong>no rights whatsoever</strong>. You can be summarily deported even if your papers are entirely in order, with no means of appeal. And I have absolutely no idea what happens then. Do they pay for your flight home? Or are you detained until you can arrange a ticket? As a student I have no spare funds to draw on, my parents are on holiday, and my girlfriend (now wife) is delerious with the &#8216;flu at&nbsp;home.</p>
<p>And a deportation makes it very hard to ever get into the <span class="caps">USA</span> again. With the American authorities still in over-compensation mode post-11/9, there&#8217;s a very real chance my academic career could get hobbled here, before it&#8217;s even&nbsp;started.</p>
<p>I almost hit panic level when Laughing Guy snaps on the rubber gloves, but it&#8217;s just to rifle through my bag. Meanwhile Dog Dude is going &#8220;Find it! Find it! Find it!&#8221; and his hound is all over me. British sniffer dogs tend to be small friendly beagles or similar &#8212; cute and floppy-eared &#8212; not this Rottweiler-sized beast. (Bit vague on breeds I&#8217;m afraid &#8212; not a dog&nbsp;person.)</p>
<p>And then just like that, it&#8217;s over. They don&#8217;t phone the conference or my college for confirmation, as I suggest. But suddenly my suspicious credentials are just fine. They don&#8217;t even search me all that thoroughly, which is obviously a blessing, but makes me wonder if they actually expected to find anything, or just wanted to put me in my place. Welcome to&nbsp;America.</p>
<h4>Bio&nbsp;diversity</h4>
<p>From talking to friends and colleagues at the time, and <a href="https://twitter.com/AstroKatie/status/520838801006936066">discussions online</a> more recently, &#8220;you don&#8217;t look like a scientist&#8221; is a pretty common reaction. I&#8217;d hope it&#8217;s much less common today, with the likes of Ben Goldacre, Simon Singh, Alice Roberts, Jim Al-Khalili and of course Brian Cox putting a more realistic face on science in the media, and I&#8217;d <em>really</em> hope the consequences of that reaction are typically much less extreme than my&nbsp;story.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s still a long way to go. Women scientists are still under-represented in the media, and our most prominent and influential is frankly <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2014/oct/03/susan-greenfield-mind-change-technology-evidence">turning out to be a bit of a crank</a>. Dawkins has retired from his Public Understanding of Science post in order to pursue his hobby of Public Misrepresentation of Science full-time, which isn&#8217;t doing anyone any favours. Of course, this is very much a <span class="caps">UK</span>-centric view, and without the <span class="caps">BBC</span> and the Guardian things would look a lot less&nbsp;encouraging.</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s not forget that presence of visible role models and a more welcoming atmosphere for younger scientists won&#8217;t necessarily equate to better career prospects. <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/chuka-umunna-pledges-action-on-lack-of-black-professors/2016295.article#.VDuf8ztJt6s.twitter">Recent <span class="caps">UK</span> figures</a> show that only 22% of professors are women and <em>less than half a percent</em> are black. These numbers are across all subjects but I doubt sciences fair any better than&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>I have no idea what the picture&#8217;s like in the States, but I haven&#8217;t been detained there recently, so maybe there&#8217;s hope&nbsp;yet.</p>
