So I got into the habit of saying &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m a scientist&amp;#8221; and glossing over the details unless people were&amp;nbsp;interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reactions from laypeople tend to run the whole gamut from intrigue to wariness and even, back in the days, occasionally outright hostility. Ten years ago, the 90s &amp;#8220;Frankenscience&amp;#8221; narrative was still lingering around, and the popular images associated with bioscience included &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GM&lt;/span&gt; crop protests, ears grown on mice, Dolly the sheep, and the horrific undercover pics from Huntingdon Life Sciences that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALF&lt;/span&gt; put on every high street. Sometimes even fellow academics I met from arts and humanities departments would totally change their demeanour when they heard a trigger word like &amp;#8220;lab.&amp;#8221; I always felt particularly disappointed when that&amp;nbsp;happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another pretty common response was &amp;#8220;Really? You don&amp;#8217;t look like a scientist.&amp;#8221; Now this usually just amused and exasperated me in roughly equal measures &amp;#8212; and still does occasionally. But one time it nearly got me&amp;nbsp;deported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Boston&amp;nbsp;manners&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s 2004, and I&amp;#8217;m arriving in Boston for &lt;a href="http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~pablo/hlt-naacl04/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HLT&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAACL&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8216;04&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;m in the first year of my PhD, going to my first international conference &amp;#8212; and my first trip outside Europe for any reason. It&amp;#8217;s the height of summer, and I&amp;#8217;m in combat shorts and a sleeveless t-shirt as usual. I get to the front of the immigration queue and hand over my documents. &amp;#8220;Business or vacation?&amp;#8221; asks the border&amp;nbsp;guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither really, I think to myself. &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m going to an academic conference,&amp;#8221; I say instead, and give its full name. &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m a PhD&amp;nbsp;student.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wasn&amp;#8217;t in the script. She stops pecking at her keyboard, squints at me over her glasses and chews this over for a moment. &amp;#8220;You&amp;#8217;re a &lt;em&gt;scientist&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;#8221; Nod. &amp;#8220;You coulda fooled me. You sure don&amp;#8217;t look like a&amp;nbsp;scientist.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a bit floored by this &amp;#8212; particularly as there&amp;#8217;s an unsettling mix of contempt and distrust creeping into her voice. I can&amp;#8217;t think of anything to say that isn&amp;#8217;t hazardously sarcastic, so I wave the conference details printout at her. She glances at it, not really interested, and calls over a colleague. &amp;#8220;This guy says he&amp;#8217;s a scientist, huh. Going to a&amp;nbsp;conference.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Oh really?&amp;#8221; chuckles the guy. &amp;#8220;Whereabouts?&amp;#8221; The Park Plaza. He laughs a bit more. &amp;#8220;They won&amp;#8217;t even let you &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the Park Plaza looking like that! Now please come with&amp;nbsp;me.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he leads me to an inspection booth, and somewhere along the way, acquires another goon with a very large sniffer&amp;nbsp;dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Waive goodbye to your&amp;nbsp;rights&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now I&amp;#8217;m starting to get seriously worried. Why the disbelief? I&amp;#8217;m in my work clothes. I&amp;#8217;ve got a slightly punky haircut and a couple of tattoos visible, but nothing you wouldn&amp;#8217;t see in London every day. And this is Massachusetts, not Arkansas,&amp;nbsp;right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more importantly &amp;#8212; I&amp;#8217;m travelling on a visa waiver form. This gives you exactly &lt;strong&gt;no rights whatsoever&lt;/strong&gt;. You can be summarily deported even if your papers are entirely in order, with no means of appeal. And I have absolutely no idea what happens then. Do they pay for your flight home? Or are you detained until you can arrange a ticket? As a student I have no spare funds to draw on, my parents are on holiday, and my girlfriend (now wife) is delerious with the &amp;#8216;flu at&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a deportation makes it very hard to ever get into the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; again. With the American authorities still in over-compensation mode post-11/9, there&amp;#8217;s a very real chance my academic career could get hobbled here, before it&amp;#8217;s even&amp;nbsp;started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost hit panic level when Laughing Guy snaps on the rubber gloves, but it&amp;#8217;s just to rifle through my bag. Meanwhile Dog Dude is going &amp;#8220;Find it! Find it! Find it!&amp;#8221; and his hound is all over me. British sniffer dogs tend to be small friendly beagles or similar &amp;#8212; cute and floppy-eared &amp;#8212; not this Rottweiler-sized beast. (Bit vague on breeds I&amp;#8217;m afraid &amp;#8212; not a dog&amp;nbsp;person.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then just like that, it&amp;#8217;s over. They don&amp;#8217;t phone the conference or my college for confirmation, as I suggest. But suddenly my suspicious credentials are just fine. They don&amp;#8217;t even search me all that thoroughly, which is obviously a blessing, but makes me wonder if they actually expected to find anything, or just wanted to put me in my place. Welcome to&amp;nbsp;America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Bio&amp;nbsp;diversity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From talking to friends and colleagues at the time, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AstroKatie/status/520838801006936066"&gt;discussions online&lt;/a&gt; more recently, &amp;#8220;you don&amp;#8217;t look like a scientist&amp;#8221; is a pretty common reaction. I&amp;#8217;d hope it&amp;#8217;s much less common today, with the likes of Ben Goldacre, Simon Singh, Alice Roberts, Jim Al-Khalili and of course Brian Cox putting a more realistic face on science in the media, and I&amp;#8217;d &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hope the consequences of that reaction are typically much less extreme than my&amp;nbsp;story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#8217;s still a long way to go. Women scientists are still under-represented in the media, and our most prominent and influential is frankly &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2014/oct/03/susan-greenfield-mind-change-technology-evidence"&gt;turning out to be a bit of a crank&lt;/a&gt;. Dawkins has retired from his Public Understanding of Science post in order to pursue his hobby of Public Misrepresentation of Science full-time, which isn&amp;#8217;t doing anyone any favours. Of course, this is very much a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;-centric view, and without the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt; and the Guardian things would look a lot less&amp;nbsp;encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let&amp;#8217;s not forget that presence of visible role models and a more welcoming atmosphere for younger scientists won&amp;#8217;t necessarily equate to better career prospects. &lt;a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/chuka-umunna-pledges-action-on-lack-of-black-professors/2016295.article#.VDuf8ztJt6s.twitter"&gt;Recent &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; figures&lt;/a&gt; show that only 22% of professors are women and &lt;em&gt;less than half a percent&lt;/em&gt; are black. These numbers are across all subjects but I doubt sciences fair any better than&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what the picture&amp;#8217;s like in the States, but I haven&amp;#8217;t been detained there recently, so maybe there&amp;#8217;s hope&amp;nbsp;yet.&lt;/p&gt;
